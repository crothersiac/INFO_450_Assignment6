Electric Vehicles 
On the market until 2023

Question:
For people looking for the highest mileage electric vehicle, which 20 cars offer the best battery range within the dataset? 
Offer the best charge speed?

Explanation:
The data that I was able to pull off of Kaggle dealt with the multiple sets of data representing the specifications 
and limits of many electric vehicles currently on the market. I chose to look into the average Voltage per ‘gallon” of 
electricity used within these vehicles, to see the most cost effective distance driver.
