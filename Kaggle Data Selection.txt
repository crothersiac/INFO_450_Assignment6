Electric Vehicles 
On the market until 2023

Question:
For people looking for the highest mileage electric vehicle, which 20 cars offer the best battery range within the dataset? 
Offer the best charge speed?

Explanation:
The data that I was able to pull off of Kaggle dealt with the multiple sets of data representing the specifications 
and limits of many electric vehicles currently on the market. I chose to look into the average kW per ‘gallon” of electricity 
used within these vehicles, to see the most cost effective distance driver. From the data that I was able to process, I was 
able to find that Renault offers the highest kWh per ‘gallon’ from the pack, with its highest values seeing about 6.3 kW per 
given mile of driving. This vehicle is closely followed by two other vehicles offered by Renault, all of which also offer 
some of the fastest charging times per vehicle. Renault vehicles seem to boast a great fuel mileage when compared to other 
electric vehicles, as well as a charge time that is almost 1.5x times faster than most of the following competition. 
The next closest performing companies that could even try to compete with Renault were non-surprisingly Tesla, but also 
Hyundai, with a vehicle that offered decent kWh per ‘gallon’, and a very close charging time to the pack leader. 
Whether they trump the competition in longevity, they do fall a tad short in the way of overall top speed, with the likes 
of Tesla, Kia, and Porshe solidifying their positions in the top 3 of that bracket.
